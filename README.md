## The Nitrax Mathematical Keyboard (hardware)

The Nitrax Mathematical Keyboard is a compact physical keyboard designed for fast mathematical input.

### Connection modes

The keyboard supports **two connection modes**:

#### 🔹 2.4 GHz wireless (USB dongle)
- Plug the USB dongle into your computer
- The keyboard connects automatically
- Lowest latency
- Recommended for desktop use

#### 🔹 Bluetooth
- Allows wireless use without a USB dongle
- Useful for laptops and mobile setups
- Slightly higher latency than 2.4 GHz (normal for Bluetooth)

Both modes behave like a **standard keyboard at the operating system level**.  
No driver installation is required for the keyboard itself.

## What this software does

The Nitrax Mathematical Keyboard software runs quietly in the background on Windows and translates key combinations from the physical keyboard into mathematical symbols.

It works globally across applications and inserts Unicode symbols directly, without using the clipboard.

## Keyboard layers and symbol input

The Nitrax Mathematical Keyboard uses a **layered design** to access mathematical symbols efficiently.

### 🔵 Blue symbols
- Press **Ctrl + Alt + key**
- Inserts the **blue symbol** printed on the key

### ⚪ Gray symbols
- Press **Ctrl + Alt + Shift + key**
- Inserts the **gray symbol** printed on the key

You can keep **Ctrl + Alt** pressed and type multiple symbols in sequence for fast input.

This design allows quick access to a large number of mathematical symbols without switching layouts or opening symbol menus.

---

## Start with Windows — what does it mean?

When **Start with Windows** is enabled, the software automatically launches in the background when you log into Windows.

- Math Mode is immediately available
- No user interaction required
- The application remains silent and accessible from the tray

This option can be enabled or disabled at any time from the tray menu.

---

## Windows security notice (SmartScreen)

On first launch, Windows may display a blue security warning screen.

This happens because:
- The application is a small independent utility
- It is not digitally code-signed yet
- It is built using **AutoHotkey**, an open-source Windows automation framework

### About AutoHotkey
AutoHotkey (AHK) is a widely used open-source scripting language for Windows, trusted by millions of users worldwide for keyboard automation and productivity tools.

The Nitrax Mathematical Keyboard software:
- Uses AutoHotkey for reliable low-level keyboard handling
- Contains no telemetry and no network access
- Runs entirely locally on your machine

### How to proceed
1. Click **More info**
2. Click **Run anyway**

This is expected behavior and completely safe.
