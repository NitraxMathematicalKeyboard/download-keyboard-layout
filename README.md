# Nitrax Math Keyboard Software

Official software package for the **Nitrax Math Keyboard** — the ultimate productivity tool for STEM professionals, students, and researchers.

## About

The **Nitrax Math Keyboard** transforms how you type mathematical equations. Instead of hunting through symbol menus or using complex shortcuts, get **instant access to 55 essential mathematical symbols** with simple key combinations.

## Features

* **55 Mathematical Symbols** — Greek letters, operators, and special characters
* **Two-Layer System** — `Ctrl + Alt` for **blue** symbols, `Ctrl + Alt + Shift` for **gray** symbols
* **Instant Access** — no more interrupting your workflow to find symbols
* **Professional Layout** — optimized for academic and research work
* **Plug & Play** — simple setup, immediate productivity boost
* **Conflict-Aware Mapping** — `Ctrl + Alt + S` is intentionally **unassigned** to avoid HP System Information conflicts on some PCs

## Installation

### Prerequisites

* **Windows** operating system
* **Nitrax Math Keyboard** (physical device)
* **Administrator** privileges for installation

### Steps

1. **Download the Software**

   * Go to **[Releases](../../releases)**
   * Download the latest `setup.exe` file

2. **Run the Installer**

   * Right-click on `setup.exe`
   * Select **“Run as administrator”**
   * Follow the installation wizard prompts

3. **Connect Your Keyboard**

   * Connect your Nitrax keyboard via **USB** or **Bluetooth**
   * The system should automatically recognize the device

4. **Start Typing**

   * Open any text editor or document
   * Use the key combinations to access mathematical symbols
   * Refer to the keyboard layout guide for symbol locations

## Usage

> **Platform support**
> Symbol shortcuts (blue/gray layers) work on **Windows**.
> On **macOS**, you can type normally with the base keys, but the Windows-style symbol shortcuts are not available.

### Basic Symbol Access (Windows)

* **Blue symbols:** hold **`Ctrl + Alt`** and press the letter key
* **Gray symbols:** hold **`Ctrl + Alt + Shift`** and press the letter key

> **Note for European keyboards:** many EU layouts include **AltGr** (Right Alt). On Windows, **AltGr = Ctrl+Alt**. For a smoother experience on EU keyboards, you can use **Right Alt (AltGr)** instead of pressing Ctrl+Alt; add **Shift** for gray symbols. On this Math Keyboard, **the Right Alt next to the space bar corresponds to AltGr**.

### Examples

* **Greek letters:** α, β, γ, δ, π, θ, λ, μ, etc.
* **Operators:** ±, ×, ÷, ≤, ≥, ≠, ∞, etc.
* **Special characters:** ∫, ∑, √, ∂, ∇, etc.

## Compatibility

* **Operating System:** Windows 10/11
* **Applications:** works with any Windows application that accepts text input
* **Connection:** USB and Bluetooth supported

## Troubleshooting

### Editor or System Shortcut Conflicts (Important)

Some applications or PCs define their own shortcuts which may override the Math Keyboard:

* **Editor-level (e.g., Microsoft Word):** Word can intercept combos like **`Ctrl + Alt + E`**, **`Ctrl + Alt + O`**, etc., before they reach the layout.
* **Computer/OEM-level (e.g., HP):** On some HP PCs, **`Ctrl + Alt + S`** opens **HP System Information**. This is why **`Ctrl + Alt + S` is not mapped** in the layout. Other manufacturers may have different global hotkeys.

#### If a shortcut is blocked in **Microsoft Word** (Microsoft 365, English UI)

1. Open Word → **File → Options → Customize Ribbon →** (bottom) **Keyboard shortcuts: Customize…**
2. Click **Press new shortcut key**, then **press the problematic combo** (e.g., `Ctrl + Alt + E`).
   Word shows **Currently assigned to:** *<command name>*.
3. In **Categories**, choose **All Commands**. In **Commands**, select the command shown in step 2.
4. In **Current keys**, select the conflicting combo and click **Remove**.
5. At the bottom, set **Save changes in:** **Normal.dotm** → **OK**, then **restart Word**.

#### If a shortcut is blocked by the **PC/OEM**

* **HP:** when the **HP System Information** window appears, **uncheck** *“Allow the shortcut key to display system information”*.
* **Other brands:** open the vendor utility (e.g., **Lenovo Vantage**, **Dell SupportAssist**, **MyASUS**) and disable the conflicting global hotkey there.

### Installation Issues

* Ensure you’re **running the installer as administrator**
* Temporarily **disable antivirus** during installation if needed
* Check **Windows compatibility mode** if using older Windows versions

### Keyboard Not Recognized

* **Reconnect** the USB cable or **re-pair** Bluetooth
* **Restart** your computer after installation
* Check Windows **Device Manager** for driver issues
